## Version 2.0.0
This is the second major update (v2.0.0) of my portfolio website! 
Now featuring:
- **GSAP animations** for smoother interactions
- **Improved SVG images** for better quality and performance
- Other refinements to enhance the user experience

## NOTE ‚ö†Ô∏è
The **Get in Touch** form is **not yet functional** in this version. It is currently a frontend-only section and will be activated in a future update.

## Future Updates
For the next major update, I plan to introduce:
- **Functional contact form**: Visitors will be able to reach out to me directly through the website.
- **Enhanced SVG animations**: Bringing SVG graphics to life with custom animations.
- Additional improvements to refine the UI/UX experience.

Stay tuned for more updates! üöÄ
