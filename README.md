# Portfolio Website

## Version 1.0.0

This is the first version (v1.0.0) of my portfolio website, built with a Neobrutalism theme. At this stage, the website serves as a simple showcase of my work without any animations.

## Future Updates (v2.0.0 / Major Update)

For the next major update (v2.0.0), I plan to introduce:

GSAP animations for smoother interactions.
1. Improved SVG images for better quality and performance.
2. Other enhancements to refine the user experience.
3. Stay tuned for upcoming updates! ðŸš€
